This repository contains the necessary PKGBUILD files required for running Puppet 2.x on Arch Linux.

These are all derived from existing AUR packages, with tweaks for them to build under Ruby 1.8. In the case of the Ruby 1.8 packages, they're lifted directly from AUR.

All rights belong to the original package builders. These are only hosted here for convenience.
